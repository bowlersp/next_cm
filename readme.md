## Overview
Use this script as a starting point for interacting with the F5 BIG-IP Next Central Manager (CM) API. The `main()` function executes a basic workflow consisting of the following:

1. **Read** AS3 declaration from a local file
2. **Create** the AS3 declaration via the CM API (POST)
3. **Deploy** the AS3 declaration to an F5 BIG-IP Next instance from
   the CM API (POST)
4. **Search** CM's AS3 declaration API for a specific tenant
   and return the ID (GET)
5. **Delete** the deployed declaration via ID (DELETE)

**PATCH** and **PUT** methods are also plumbed into the script (as seen within the `api_call()` function), but the initial iteration of the test workflow does not leverage them. They will be added to showcase reading and deploying a newer version of an AS3 declaration from a file.

#### UPDATE:
**PATCH** and **PUT** methods for `/mgmt/shared/appsvcs/declare` have been tested, but are not yielding success. Attempts to perform PATCHes against the API result in a 400 Method not allowed error message

```
{
    "message": "method not allowed"
}
```

Attempts to PUT a modified declaration to the CM API appear successful at first, and results are reflected when viewing the declaraion with CM's UI, but changes are not observed. The test scenario for this repo involves two versions of a declaration:

1. AS3 decrlation with no pool members
2. AS3 declaration updated to include two pool members

The pool members do not appear under the App Service topology view in the CM UI.


In its current state, the script, when run, will execute a static series of events, due to the fact its designed simply to execute the `main()` function and its contents. The script could, and should, be improved to accept command-line arguments which can be passed in, such as `filename` and `instances`. This would make the script more useable and dynamic rather than fixed and static.

## Prerequisites
Create a local file in the same directory as the project named `.env` and populate it with the following variables:

- `ENDPOINT`
- `USERNAME`
- `PASSWORD`

The file contents should resemble the following:

```
ENDPOINT=testcmapi.f5demo.com
USERNAME=thebestusername
PASSWORD=theworstpassword
```

## Script Execution
Run the following command to initiate the CM API test sequence. The script will pause itself after deploying and self-validating the declaration exists, allowing for manual testing and validation prior to deletion.

```
python3 cm_as3_test.py
```
