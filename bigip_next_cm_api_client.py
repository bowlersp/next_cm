F5 BIG-IP Next Central Manager API Client Test Script

This simple API client seeks to demonstrate the following features:

 - AS3 declaration creation, deployment, and deletion
 - FAST application service creation, deployment, and deletion

The main() function contains code which triggers AS3 and FAST tests.
The tests currently supported are:

 - as3_test()
 - fast_appsvc_test()

More detailed information about test functions may be found in front of
their respective code blocks.

This flat script is meant to serve as an introduction to managing 
F5 BIG-IP Next application service deployments via the Central Manager API.
Ideally, this should be converted into a class / library so that its
functionality may be referenced within other Python scripts, easing integration
with pre-existing Python-oriented automation processes.
